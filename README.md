# TransferLearning-ResNet50

Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models as a starting point on a related problem. DCNN could take a lot of time while training large datasets, hence transfer learning provides a shortcut by diving the network into pieces and each can be trained individually and we can use transfer learning to stitch the networks we are interested in. In general transfer, learning has the advantage of reducing the training time and could result in lower generalization error.
